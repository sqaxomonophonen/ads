 - FIXME: why doesn't cursor brks work inside word calls? e.g. in
   :test_recursion I expect to be able to break inside :gcd, but it doesn't
   work, and also not in all (most?) other tests

 - library support and type tags for graphs / curves / symbol-sequences +
   dedicated renderers in hack.js

 - step forward/backward, step in/out, goto next/prev brk
