 - FIXME: cursor/brk stuff is a bit "jank": inside loops it doesn't catch all
   iterations? in :test_times_loop, in the nested loop it only passes the
   cursor 4 times, but it should be 12. in :test_performance, with cursor on
   "times", try increasing iterations: the stack should not grow. end-of-word:
   should show return value; but it doesn't always? cursor inside words other
   than the one tagged doesn't always work.

 - library support and type tags for graphs / curves / symbol-sequences +
   dedicated renderers in hack.js

 - step forward/backward, step in/out, goto next/prev brk
