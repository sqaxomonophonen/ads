 - FIXME: cursor/brk stuff is a bit "jank": inside loops it doesn't catch all
   iterations? in :test_times_loop, in the nested loop it only passes the
   cursor 4 times, but it should be 12. in :test_performance, with cursor on
   "times", try increasing iterations: the stack should not grow. end-of-word:
   should show return value; but it doesn't always? cursor inside words other
   than the one tagged doesn't always work.

 - render rstack too? and globals?

 - library support and type tags for graphs / curves / symbol-sequences +
   dedicated renderers in hack.js

 - stepping/running? step in/out? 1 step? continue to prev/next brk? I could
   probably abuse one of the goto's, e.g. "textDocument/typeDefinition" in
   combination with a "workspace/executeCommand" that sets the context, and
   thus get an infinite amount of goto commands instead of the 3 LSP offers
