 - FIXME: cursor breakpoint at word-call is weird/broken because it enters the
   function instead of running it in entirety (funny that it seemed to work
   before, but the breakpoint was also off-by-one which kind of makes sense?)

 - FIXME: entrypoint selection at ": test_recursion" (except the first column)
   selects ": gcd" from the line below

 - library support and type tags for graphs / curves / symbol-sequences +
   dedicated renderers in hack.js

 - goto word implementation (on <C-q>)

 - step forward/backward, step in/out, goto next/prev brk
